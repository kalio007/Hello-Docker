install docker for your machine
visit the link - https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/

if you experience the wsl2 issue visit 
-https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package
to update your wsl version on your system or run -  wsl.exe --update on your terminal to update your wsl

install the update for wsl
run - $ docker version 
this to check if your docker engine is running 
also you server must be running else we go through the process again

whats a dockerfile, how does docker implement it changes

when we take an application we dockerate it 

dockerfile is a plain text file that inlcudes information that docker uses to package up information into an image

-image contians everything our application needs to run 
 1. the cut-down os
 2.a runtime environment
 3. application file 
 4. application variable

docker container are built based on the docekrfile image
conatianer is just a process- the apllication is ran insdie the contianer 

$ docker run ...

docker hub
after creatimg the docker image we send it to a registry cslled the docker hub just like github stores codes
then from the docker hub we can send it to any production machine 

starting out
 create a directory $mkdir hello-docker
 create a file App.js

insert picture

in order to run this program on another machine we reuire to the following instruction
-start with an OS
-install Node
-copy app files
-run node app.js

for a bigger program we would have lot sof stuff to run so docker comes in

to run our small app with docker 
1. create the docker file
 Dockerfile - ensure the D is capital and everyother snamll letters, it has no file extenison
2. install the docker extension if you have none on you

3. we build the the base image on the docker andd add other images to it
more like iherentance

FROM Baseimage:tag(which linux dirtibution we want to use)alphine(image)
COPY we need to copy the files in the directory to the app directory into the iamge
WORKDIR to direct to the working directory
CMD Command instruction to excute the command 

next we run the docker build 
in your terminal type 
$ docker build -t (name )hello-docker .(where docker can find the docker file).


Linux 


Building docker images

it contains all the information needed to start a contianer that best suit the apllication to be ran

contianer 
-provides and isolated environs
-can be stopped & restarted
-its just a porcess

starting...

we need a docker file which contians the information for building an image

FROM -spcifitying the base image
WORKDIR - working directory
COPY
ADD
RUN- ecutring woriking command
ENV -sending environment variable
EXPOSE -which port its running on
USER -
CMD- 
ENTRYPOINT-
